# Obstacle Avoidance in Self-Driving Cars Using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)

This project implements advanced **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)** strategies for obstacle avoidance in self-driving cars.  
The controller ensures safety and passenger comfort while handling lane centering, input-rate limiting, and multi-obstacle avoidance.  
The optimization problem is formulated and solved using **CasADi in Python**.
